# Laplacian-blob-detector
Generating blob detector for ECE558 DIS
Generated a image pyramid to construc Difference of Gaussian (DoG) of an image to find out the intensity difference at various location in the image. Generated the pyramid in order to identify blobs of different sizes. Used python3, numpy, cv2 for the project.
